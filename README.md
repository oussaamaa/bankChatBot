Our project is composed of 3 applications , the first one is a chatbot 
written in Node.js (and we used firebase) which is the mediator between 
citizens and the 
government.
The second application is about a web scrapper written in python and using 
the beautifulsoup. We have tried to integrate the DialogFlow entities for 
our NLP training.
We have started working on multichain and eutherum in order to choose one 
of them to store the distributed data of the job's recruitment.
